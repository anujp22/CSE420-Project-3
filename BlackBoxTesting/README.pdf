README should include:
• Names and IDs of the group members.
• Your performance analysis text as described above. We do not expect less than a paragraph and
more than a few paragraphs.
• Did you take any measures against the lock contention and IPC communication costs mentioned
above?
• Did you fully implement the project as described? If not, what parts are not implemented at all
or not implemented as following the specified description? Note that for this project, it is very
easy to achieve the required output without using any linked lists, message queues, multi-threading,
multi-processing, etc., or it is also very easy to distort your execution times as mentioned above.
Implementing the project without following the specified description or by distorting the execution
times will be considered as plagiarism if not properly documented in this README.pdf file.
• Structure of your messages. What size did you use for your messages and why?
